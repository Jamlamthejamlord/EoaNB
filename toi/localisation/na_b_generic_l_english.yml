Since the early 1850's railway companies have been given grants by the United States government which has funded this westward expansion. Though funding is no the only hurdle, as the first nations people often resist the railway construction and sabotage progress. The railways not only bring more settlers, but also disrupt the bufflo population has settlers shoot bufflo for sport. This has dramatically reduced the bufflo population and greatly hurt the nomadic lifestyle of the first nations people.§!"
