 eoanb_norway.0.t:0 "Hans Christian Heg Dead"
 eoanb_norway.0.d:0 "Hans Christian Heg, a Norwegian immigrant and Colonel in the union army has died of wounds during the Battle of Chickamauaga. Heg was a vocal anti-slavery activist, and fought for the preservation of the Union.\nHe came to the US with his family when he was eleven years old, settling in Muskego, Wisconsin. At twenty he briefely moved to California to seek wealth trough gold mining, but moved back after two years. When the civil war broke out he was appointed Colonel by the Wisconsin govenor, which he accepted, and subsequently died because of that."
 eoanb_norway.0.a:0 "Rest in peace"

 eoanb_norway.2.t:0 "The Murder of Knut Grøte"
 eoanb_norway.2.d:0 "On 10 August 1863 Knut Grøte was murdered by Friedrich Priess and Knud Simonsen from Prussia and Denmark. Today, the Norwegian supreme court sentenced both to death. Maybe this will scare off all the other filthy criminals?"
 eoanb_norway.2.a:0 "How could such a thing happen?"

 eoanb_norway.3.t:0 "Constuction Started On The Storting Building"
 eoanb_norway.3.d:0 "After much planning, constuction of the Storting has started. A design competition was held in 1856, and after a vote in the Storting, the submission by Swedish architect Emil Victor Langlet was chosen as the final design of the building.\nSince 1854, the parliament has been using a conference room in the Royal Fredrick University, and the people's representatives are surely happy to finally move out once it is complete."
 eoanb_norway.3.a:0 "Very well"
 eoanb_norway.3.b:0 "About time!"

 eoanb_norway.4.t:0 "The Storting Building Is Completed"
 eoanb_norway.4.d:0 "After roughly five and a half years of construction, the storting building is complete. This marks a significant step towards Norwegian independence. Before this, the Storting used a conference hall in the Royal Fredrick University.\nThis building is an artifact of the stable Norwegian regime, and will undoubtedly be a popular tourist attraction in the coming years."
 eoanb_norway.4.a:0 "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.5.t:0 "Venstre Has Been Established"
 eoanb_norway.5.d:0 "As the first formal political party in Norway, it will mark the start of a new era in Norwegian democracy. Venstre, literally \"Left\", is made up of MP's wanting to reform the Norwegian democracy. Its leader, Johan Sverdrup, has a goal of implementing parliamentarism in the Storting, but is met with strong opposition from the conservative members of parliament. \nInformal political parties have existed in the Storting before this, but have been limited to just that, informal political parties. Hopefully this will make it easier to know who to vote for."
 eoanb_norway.5.a:0 "Interesting"

 eoanb_norway.6.t:0 "Høyre Has Been Established"
 eoanb_norway.6.d:0 "In reaction to Venstre being established earlier this year, the conservative members of parliament has decided to form their own political party. Høyre, literally \"Right\", is mostly made up of businessmen and powerful leaders. Representing conservative people in Norway, it will work against the proposals of Venstre, with a possibilty of cooperation with the moderate wing of Venstre."
 eoanb_norway.6.a:0 "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.7.t:0 "Vogt Pressured By the Swedish Crown"
 eoanb_norway.7.d:0 "Jørgen Herman Vogt, government leader since 1855 has been pressured by the King of Sweden to resign. This is because Vogt had a conflict with the king over his military appointments, and is now threatening Vogts position as leader of government."
 eoanb_norway.7.a:0 "Call a vote in the Storting"
 eoanb_norway.7.b:0 "Vogt's resignation"

 eoanb_norway.8.t:0 "Who Should Be Vogt's Successor?"
 eoanb_norway.8.d:0 "After Vogt's resignation we are left with an obvious question; Who should be his successor? Several prominient politicians have come with their own proposals, as well as the King of Sweden. Who should be his successor?"
 eoanb_norway.8.a:0 "The Crown Prince of Sweden Charles XV"
 eoanb_norway.8.b:0 "Conservative Hans Christian Petersen"

 eoanb_norway.9.t:0 "Jørgen Herman Vogt Gets to Keep His Power"
 eoanb_norway.9.d:0 "After about two months of discourse Jørgen Herman Vogt, and his friends in the Storting have voted against the choice of the king. The king has no obligation to act upon the advice of the Storting, but has chosen to accept its terms because he does not want to upset the Norwegian populace."
 eoanb_norway.9.a:0 "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.10.t:0 "Jørgen Herman Vogt Is Forced to Resign"
 eoanb_norway.10.d:0 "Today, the Norwegian Head of Government officially resigned as a consequence of Swedish pressure. The Swedish King may celebrate as he successfully cleared space for his friend Christian Birch-Reichenwald in the government. Birch-Reichenwald has long been a good friend of King Charles XV, and is probably wanted because Vogt has been critical of some of the King's military appointments. Vogt's age may also be a factor concerning the demand, as the aging politician is at this point in his 70's."
 eoanb_norway.10.a:0 "Not much we can do"

 eoanb_norway.11.t:0 "The End of The Feud"
 eoanb_norway.11.d:0 "The current political feud is officially over, and we have sucessfully chosen our preferred leader. Although, even if this conflict has been solved, there are still some major conflicts in this country. \nThese revolve mainly around the minority group of \"embedsmenn\" who dominate the Norwegian politcal landscape. Nevertheless, we may now relax and watch what is happening in the world; at least for the time being."
 eoanb_norway.11.a:0 "Very well!"

 eoanb_norway.12.t:0 "Opening of Hamar-Grundsetbanen"
 eoanb_norway.12.d:0 "In 1857, together with Kongsvingerbanen and Trondhjem-Størenbanen, constuction of Hamar-Grundsetbanen was approved in the Storting, and is now the first one of the railways to be completed. The next railway, Kongsvingerbanen is expected to open soon."
 eoanb_norway.12.a:0 "Splendid"

 eoanb_norway.13.t:0 "Opening of Kongsvingerbanen"
 eoanb_norway.13.d:0 "Some time after the completion and opening of Hamar-Grundsetbanen, Kongsvingerbanen has officialy opened. In contrast to the previous railway, this is the first one to use the standard-gauge rail, as it uses a smaller gauge. Anyway, this is a small improvement of the infrastructure in Norway; even if large parts of the country still lack railways."
 eoanb_norway.13.a:0 "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.14.t:0 "Great Christiania Fire"

 eoanb_norway.16.a:0 "Wonderful"

 eoanb_norway.17.t:0 "Election of 1859"
 eoanb_norway.17.d:0 "The 16th Storting election has been announced, deciding the fate of the representatives in the Norwegian Parliament. Individuals are voted for in the largest election to date, with electoral seats being expanded from 111 to 117. A conflict between the more liberal minded Bønder (Farmers) and the more staunchly conservative Embedsmenn (Officials) has been the topic of debate as of recent. With more seats in parliament after the addition of the 57th clause in the Norwegian constitution, farmers now have 2 representatives in parliament for every 1 representative of townsfolk. With this in mind, many of the more rural people in Norway banded together to form proto-political parties, namely the Reformforeningen (Reform Association), a group of liberal oppositionists against the more conservative population. On the other side are the conservatives, a group of civil servants and government officials who have dominated Norwegian politics since 1814. With every county voting for their own representatives, the question now looms, who has won the majority of the seats? The more liberal-minded Bønder, or the more conservative Embedsmenn?"
