 ROM_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Wallachia and of course, Moldovia, are in a state of change. Not long ago, in 1834, the phanariot rule came to an end and local nobles became princes of the two principalities but this was only a small success for the Romanians. In 1848, the age of revolutions, a revolutionary government was defeated by the Ottomans and the monarchy was reinstaurated. The last prince of Wallachia, Barbu Ştirbey, named for 7 years(from 1849 to 1856) ended his reign exactly at the end of the Crimean War, and the Ottomans rejected a longer reign due to his unionist sentiment, a sentiment the people also have. Now the former prince A.D Ghika is camimacan (regent) of Wallachia, and he is a supporter of the unionist cause and a great reformer, tho Moldavia is in a different case..."
 POLITICS_AD_GHIKA_DESC:0 "Alexandru Dimitrie Ghica (Ghika) was prince of Wallachia during the regulations' period (named due to the Organic Regulations) from 1834 to 1842. Now he is the caimacan of Wallachia, observing the Ad-Hoc Divans and the road to unification. He is a reformer and modern ruller as well as a strong unionist."

 wallachia_focustree.1.d:0 "The Industrial situation in Wallachia is as expected, horrible. With countless wars ruining any chances for the development of a industry, Wallachia based itself on the agriculture, which, while also sometimes destroyed by wars between the Ottomans and Russian was still worth investing in. Still, the Crimean War has caused much more damage than we would have wanted to our agriculture. On the bright side, some of our advisors are proposing that this is the right time to begin to industrialize and modernize Vlach society as a whole."
